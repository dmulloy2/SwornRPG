# SwornRPG
SwornRPG is a lightweight and fully-featured alternative to mcMMO. It is based upon a leveling system in which daily tasks such as farming, fighting players and mobs, enchanting, taming, and being on the server yield experience. As with any good leveling system, SwornRPG awards players with items and money (both of which are configurable) each time they gain enough experience to level up! Players also receive increased ability times and greater chances for many of SwornRPG's extra features! Players can check their xp and level using ````/level```` and check the leaderboard with ````/srpg top````.

### Salvaging
This plugin allows for the salvaging of used armor. Salvaging the used armor gives the player SOME of the ingots back, but it is designed to be inefficient. For example: If you salvage a full set of unused diamond armor, you will only get 20 diamonds back (using the config defaults). If the armor is used, the plugin calculates how many ingots the player should receive based on what you defined in the configuration.
